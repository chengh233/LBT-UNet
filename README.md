# Learning by Teaching for Semantic Segmentation based on U-Net

## Introduction

In this project, we optimized image semantic segmentation performance by applying [Learning by Teaching (LBT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07009) onto [U-Net model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597), which is a convolutional network architecture for fast and precise segmentation of images. We used general idea of LBT algorithm to improve the running performance of model.
